# ML Algorithms from scratch

> A python only implementation of the Algorithms used for ML from scratch.

**Note**: This project uses external dependencies for the testing of the algorithms.

### Available algorithms

- Linear regression (`linear_regression`)
- Logistic regression (`logistic_regression`)
- Decision Trees (`decision_tree`)
- Adaboost (`adaboost`)
- Random forest (`random_forest`)
- Naive Bayes (`naive_bayes`)
- KNN (`knn`)
- KMeans (`kmeans`)
- PCA [Principal component analysis] (`pca`)
- SVM (`svm`)

## Installation and usage.

This project has 4 dependencies.

- `numpy` for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms
- `Scikit-learn` for the data generation and testing.
- `Matplotlib` for the plotting.

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. You need to ensure that you have `pipenv`
installed on your system.

Here's how to install the dependencies, and get started.

- Install it using **`pipenv sync -d`**
- Once done, Activate the environment using **`pipenv shell`**.

Now, You're ready to run the Algorithms!

You can run them using `python -m algorithms.<algorithm_name>`, Where `<algorithm_name>` needs to be replaced
with a valid algorithm name. Check the supported algorithms to see which ones are available.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome. After cloning & setting up project locally, you
can just submit a PR to this repo and it will be deployed once it's accepted.

⚠️ It’s good to have descriptive commit messages, or PR titles so that other contributors can understand about your
