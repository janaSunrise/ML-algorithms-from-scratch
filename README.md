# ML Algorithms from scratch

> A python only implementation of the Algorithms used for ML from scratch.

**Note**: This project does use external dependencies for the testing of the algorithms.

### Available algorithms

- Linear regression (`linear_regression`)
- Logistic regression (`logistic_regression`)
- Decision Trees (`decision_tree`)
- Adaboost (`adaboost`)
- Random forest (`random_forest`)

## Installation and usage.

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. You need to ensure that you have `pipenv`
installed on your system.

Here's how to install the dependencies, and get started.

- Install it using **`pipenv sync -d`**
- Once done, Activate the environment using **`pipenv shell`**.

Now, You're ready to run the Algorithms!

You can run them using `python -m algorithms.<algorithm_name>`, Where `<algorithm_name>` needs to be replaced
with a valid algorithm name. Check the supported algorithms to see which ones are available.
